Larrabee and Sergio,

Regarding the Princeton presentation, maybe we could iterate on what
we think are the critical aspects that we should mention/discuss.

Here are some suggestions for potential critical aspects to mention in
the Princeton presentation (keep in mind that most of this community
is not knowledgeable of almost any of this – we should not assume that
they much about it):

What are hyperspectral IR instruments/missions

A bit of history (since the 1970s… or early)

AIRS as a pioneer hyperspectral instrument

The value of hyperspectral information to a variety of objectives: weather, climate, composition, applications

The dramatic impact in NWP

(AIRS started as weather mission and became a climate mission)

Atmospheric physics (weather and climate) examples

Composition examples

IASI and CrIS

The value of radiance observations for understanding climate and climate change

Radiance stability and long term records

How to use hyperspectral IR data to improve and evaluate climate models (some examples)

The spectral OLR of Xianglei is interesting to  mention

Showing your recent work on T and q trends and climate feedbacks would be good

CHIRP

Future and continuity
….
